        <h1 class="font1">Companies offering self-driven car on rent.</h1>
        <p class="font-1">Till few years back, the market of self-driven cars did not even exist. However, between
            years, the scene has changed quite dramatically and what we now see is a trend, where several companies who
            invested in the idea are competing to be the best in the business. We like the idea of self-driven cars
            solely because of the reason that they offer flexibility and independence that a normal chauffer driven cab
            does not.

            The self driven car service is a boon for those who wish to travel throughout India, and avoid the inherent
            hassle that comes along with the mass transport system. We discuss the most popular self-rental cars
            companies that are operating in India .</p>
        <p>
        <h1>1. Myles</h1>
        <div class="home-blogpost1-img">
            <img src="img/blogpost131.jpg" alt="blog13">
        </div>
        Myles is a rental car division that is owned and managed by carzonrent. Carzonrent is in fact India’s largest
        car rental/hire company. The service network of the Myles is perhaps the vastest. The company covers 21 major
        Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Goa, Jaipur, Chennai, Pune, Mysore, Udaipur etc.). The
        company offers 20 models of the cars to choose from. The plans are flexible and you can avail the service for a
        minimum period of 2 hours to even months.

        On specific cars, the company offers huge discounts if you avail the service for a long period of week or month.
        In addition, the convenience of booking a cab can also be availed by using an Android application that the
        company offers.
        </p>


        <p>
        <h1>2. Zoom Car</h1>
        <div class="home-blogpost1-img">
            <img src="img/blogpost132.jpg" alt="blog13">
        </div>
        Zoom car is another impressive service provider that offers services in only few major cities (Bangalore, Pune,
        Delhi / NCR, Mumbai, Chennai) at present. The company offers a range of 13 cars to choose from, cheapest one
        being the Tata Nano and the most expensive one being – Mercedes GLA. You can rent the Mercedes A class for as
        low as 190/hour, which also includes the fuel. You can drive the car up to 10kms, thereafter would be charged Rs
        25 per kilometer.

        The rental plans are as flexible as any other and you can rent a car for an hour or even for a month. The
        company also offers iPhone and Android application that can be used to conveniently book a car.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h1>3. Eco Rent a car.</h1>
        <div class="home-blogpost1-img">
            <img src="img/blogpost133.jpg" alt="blog13">
        </div>
        The company offers services in every major city like Agra, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Delhi, Ranchi etc. The company
        is unique in a sense that it offers wide range services like – Corporate car rental, Employee transportation
        services, Event transportation etc.

        The self-driven car service of the company though is only available in very few cities – Bangalore, Delhi-NCR,
        Mumbai, Pune. The company is not as well-known as some of the other brands in the self-driven cars category but
        has wide range of cars on offer – BMW 3-series, BMW 5-series, BMW 7-series, Mercedes S-Class, Audi Q7 etc. The
        lack of Android and iPhone app is big minus point.</p>
        <p>
        <h1>4. Avis.</h1>
        <div class="home-blogpost1-img">
            <img src="img/blogpost134.jpg" alt="blog13">
        </div>
        Avis is a truly Global company and operates in over 136 countries worldwide. It offers wide range of car rental
        / hire services and is more like ECO Rent A Car in some sense that self-driven rental cars is not the only
        service that it provides. The company offers cars ranging from Audi to Honda.

        The self driving cars can be rented at weekly and per day rate basis. In India, the company operates in 19
        cities over 42 locations. The car rental facility though is available in only in few major cities like (Delhi,
        Chennai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Mumbai and Hyderabad) and the company offers only two cars for this purpose –
        Toyota Innova and Toyota Etios.

        There’s an application available for iPhone, Android, Blackberry as well as the Windows phone to book a cab.</p>
        <p>
        <h1>5. Let me drive.</h1>
        <div class="home-blogpost1-img">
            <img src="img/blogpost135.jpg" alt="blog13">
        </div>
        Unlike other service providers, Let Me Drive operates only in Delhi NCR region. The company offers only
        self-driving car rental services. The fleet of cars that they offer includes Wagon R, Figo, Sunny, Swift Dzire,
        Evalia and Innova. The USP of the service is that the cars are available at more affordable rate. You can rent a
        Wagon R for a rate as low as Rs. 949 / day.

        The company’s service is impressive; however, since the fleet of cars is not very large, you may need to book
        the cab well in advance to be able to receive a car on time. Unfortunately, there is no smart phone application
        available to book the service which is another big minus point of the service.

        The self-driven cars have certain disadvantages too, which you must keep in mind before you go out and rent a
        car. The sole responsibility of the car lies with the person who rents the car. Therefore, you must be extra
        careful while driving. Generally, companies include a clause in the terms and conditions which make you liable
        to pay for the collateral damages.
