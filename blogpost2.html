        Parasite is definitely a "must watch" movie which has won four Oscars at the Oscars 2020 for Best Picture, Best
        Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film.

        Directed by Bong Joon Ho, it is a good example of how a class discrimination is narrated with a dark-comedy.
        Greed, class discrimination and a mysterious interloper threaten the newly formed symbiotic relationship between
        the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kim clan.

        Directed by acclaimed director Woody Allen, Woody Allen's new film "Cafe Society" takes you back to the
        Hollywood's Golden Age in the 1930s with much more disaturated, glamorous, but brighter backdrops.

        The film captures a specific era of Hollywood at that time after the term Cafe Society come to light in the
        1930's-and that time is reflected in the film as diverging aesthetic by the supervision of production designer
        Santo Loquasto.

        A roughly 1-hour comedy-drama, written and directed by Wes Anderson, elaborates the story of tragedy, war,
        fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. It recounts the adventures of legendary concierge Gustave H. and
        Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.

        The story involves the theft of a priceless painting; a raging battle for an enormous family fortune; and a
        desperate chase on motorcycles, trains, sleds, and skis - all against the back-drop of a suddenly and
        dramatically changing Continent.

        The film is very assertive in terms of its interiors and its exuberant color palette with textures, saturation,
        matte paintings, miniature effect techniques to create different perspectives of scenes, creating the illusion
        of size and grandeur. If you want to be in a fully pinkish world and want to be exposed to major miniature
        models, you should watch it!.

        Directed by Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, the 2-hours film is about living and breathing a resort. The film
        was mostly shot at Waldhaus Flims Grand Hotel & Spa, elaborating a specific but a very modern, architecturally
        minimal spa with a floaty manner.

        The film is the director's second English language film, and stars Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel as best
        friends who reflect on their lives while holidaying in the Swiss Alps. It turns into a story of the eternal
        struggle between age and youth, the past and the future, life and death, commitment and betrayal
