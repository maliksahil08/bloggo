        <h1 class="font1">Everything to know about Covid-19.</h1>
        <p class="font-1">The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named
            coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
            Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’

            <br>The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
            Syndrome
            (SARS) and some types of common cold.

            <br><b>Q.How does the COVID-19 virus spread?</b>
            <br>sThe virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person
            (generated
            through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may
            survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.

            <br><b>Q.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</b>
            Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
            pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.

            <br>These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than
            COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember
            that key prevention measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough
            or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin).

            <br><b>Q.How can I avoid the risk of infection?</b>
            <br>Here are four precautions you and your family can take to avoid infection:
            <br><b>1. Wash your hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.</b>
            <br><b>2. Cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose used tissue
                immediately.</b>
            <br><b>3. Avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms.</b>
            <br><b>4. Seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.</b>
            <br><b>Q.Should I wear a mask?</b>
            <br>The use of a mask is advised to protect others even if you have no symptoms.

            <br>After masks are worn, they must be used and disposed of properly to ensure their effectiveness and to
            avoid
            any increased risk of transmitting the virus.

            <br>The use of a mask alone is not enough to stop infections and must be combined with frequent hand washing
            with soap and maintaining physical distance.

            <br><b>Q.Does COVID-19 affect children?</b>
            <br>COVID-19 is a new virus, and we are still learning about how it affects children and pregnant women. We
            know
            people of any age can be infected and transmit the virus. However, older people and/or those with
            pre-existing medical conditions seem more likely to develop severe illness. Cold, mild cough, fever, and
            body pain are the common symptoms of infection. We have also noted that other symptoms such as pain in the
            abdomen, loose motions, and vomiting are also present in children.

            <br>Clinical features or symptoms affecting children and adolescents, possibly associated with COVID-19, can
            include but are not limited to: fever, headache, body pain, tiredness, cough, breathlessness, poor feeding,
            loss of taste or smell (in a child more than eight years old), rash, red or pink eyes, swollen and/or red
            lips, tongue, hands, feet, gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, vomiting).


            <br><b>Q.What should I do if my child has symptoms of COVID-19 or has been in contact with someone who has
                tested
                positive?</b>
            <br>Seek medical attention. If advised by the doctor, then get your child tested for COVID-19. If advised by
            a
            doctor isolate/stay home.

            <br>Record temperature and oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter if available at home, every 6 hours.
            Measure
            their temperature frequently. If it is more than 100-degree F, then you can do tepid sponging with tap water
            and give them syrup or tablet paracetamol. If fever is >100°F, give paracetamol 10–15 mg/kg/dose.

            <br>Continue to follow good hand and respiratory hygiene practices like regular handwashing with soap so
            that
            your child is protected against other viruses and bacteria causing diseases.

            <br>Continue to follow personal protective measures for yourself and your child. Your child should wear a
            surgical mask anytime they are around people. Change the mask after eight hours of continuous wear.
            Caregivers interacting with the child should wear gloves and a mask.

            <br>Feed your child home-cooked food and keep them well hydrated. Give plenty of liquids and give a soft and
            light diet. One may give vitamin C, zinc to boost overall health and immunity

            <br>Other nutritional supplements like syrup multivitamin, Vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium can be given as per
            their doctor’s advice.

            <br>Be watchful for danger signs and if any of these signs are present, seek urgent medical advice at your
            nearest hospital.


            <br>1. Indrawing of chest.
            <br>2.Grunting sounds.
            <br>3.The child looks pale or blue.
            <br>4.Peripheries feel cold.
            <br>5.Sunken eyeballs and dry mouth.
            <br>6.Not passed urine for more than 3- 4 hours (for children less than 5 years of age).
            <br>7.Refusing to feed.
            <br>8.Looks drowsy or lethargic.
            <br>9.Abnormal body movement.
            <br>10.Severe diarrhea, vomiting or abdominal pain.

            <br><b>Q.What is the best way to wash hands properly?</b>
            <br>Step 1:Wet hands with running water

            <br>Step 2: Apply enough soap to cover wet hands

            <br>Step 3: Scrub all surfaces of the hands – including back of hands, between fingers and under nails – for
            at
            least 20 seconds

            <br>Step 4: Rinse thoroughly with running water

            <br>Step 5: Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel

            <br>Wash your hands often, especially before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and
            going
            to the bathroom.

            <br>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60%
            alcohol.
            Always wash hands with soap and water, if hands are visibly dirty.

            <br><b>Q.What precautions should I take for my family if we travel?</b>
            <br>Anyone planning a trip overseas should always check the travel advisory for their destination country
            for
            any restrictions on entry, quarantine requirements on entry, or other relevant travel advice.

            <br>In addition to taking standard travel precautions, and in order to avoid being quarantined or denied
            re-entry into your home country, you are also advised to check the latest COVID-19 update on the
            International Air Transport Association website, which includes a list of countries and restriction
            measures.

            <br>While traveling, all parents should follow standard hygiene measures for themselves and their children:
            Wash
            hands frequently or use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol, practice good
            respiratory hygiene (cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze and
            immediately dispose of the used tissue) and avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

            <br>In addition, it is recommended that parents always carry a hand sanitizer, pack of disposable tissues,
            and
            disinfecting wipes.

            <br>Additional recommendations include: Clean your seat, armrest, touchscreen, etc. with a disinfecting wipe
            once inside an aircraft or other vehicle. Also use a disinfecting wipe to clean key surfaces, doorknobs,
            remote controls, etc at the hotel or other accommodation where you and your children are staying.

            <br><b>Q.Can pregnant women pass coronavirus to unborn children?</b>
            <br>At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether the virus is transmitted from a mother
            to
            her baby during pregnancy, or the potential impact this may have on the baby. This is currently being
            investigated. Pregnant women should continue to follow appropriate precautions to protect themselves from
            exposure to the virus, and seek medical care early, if experiencing symptoms, such as fever, cough or
            difficulty breathing.

            <br>
            <bQ.Is it safe for a mother to breastfeed if she is infected with coronavirus?</b>

                <br>All mothers in affected and at-risk areas who have symptoms of fever, cough or difficulty breathing,
                should
                seek medical care early, and follow instructions from a health care provider.

                <br>Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breastmilk in the
                transmission of
                other respiratory viruses, the mother can continue breastfeeding, while applying all the necessary
                precautions.

                <br>For symptomatic mothers well enough to breastfeed, this includes wearing a mask when near a child
                (including
                during feeding), washing hands before and after contact with the child (including feeding), and
                cleaning/disinfecting contaminated surfaces – as should be done in all cases where anyone with confirmed
                or
                suspected COVID-19 interacts with others, including children.

                <br>If a mother is too ill, she should be encouraged to express milk and give it to the child via a
                clean cup
                and/or spoon – all while following the same infection prevention methods.
