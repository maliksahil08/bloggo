        <h1 class="font1">Hollywood Actors with career best performances.</h1>
        <p class="font-1">We begin a more granular exploration into some of those movies — and a handful of others — by
            highlighting the actors who made them possible. Not all of these performances have been pulled from the
            films that made it onto our list of the decade’s best, but every single one of them has stayed with us in
            the time since they first touched down. From immortal turns from acting giants who are no longer with us, to
            stunning debuts that already have us looking forward to the next decade of movies</p>

        <h1>1. Marlon Brando – The Godfather (1972)</h1>

        Brando’s great comeback sees him playing Vito Corleone, the patriarch of a fictional New York crime family.
        After months of debate between directer Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount over Brando’s casting, the studio
        president Stanley Jaffe required him to perform a screen test. Coppola did not want to offend Brando and stated
        that he needed to test equipment in order to set up the screen test at Brando’s California residence. For
        make-up, Brando stuck cotton balls in his cheeks, put shoe polish in his hair to darken it, and rolled his
        collar. Coppola placed Brando’s audition tape in the middle of the videos of the audition tapes as the Paramount
        executives watched them. The executives were impressed with Brando’s efforts and allowed Coppola to cast Brando
        for the role if Brando accepted a lower salary and put up a bond to ensure he would not cause any delays in
        production. Brando received a net participation deal which earned him $1.6 million. His mesmerising performance
        revitalised a career that had gone into decline during the 1960s and brought him a best actor Oscar.

        <h1>2. Heath Ledger – The Dark Knight (2008)</h1>

        In the second of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, Ledger starred as the anarchistic mastermind known as the
        Joker, who seeks to undermine Batman’s influence and throw the city of Gotham into anarchy. Some mocked Ledger’s
        casting when it first became public but Nolan had wanted to work with him on a number of previous projects
        (including unsuccessfully approaching him for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger’s
        chaotic interpretation of the character. Ledger died on January 22, 2008, some months after he completed filming
        and six months before the film’s release from a toxic combination of prescription drugs, leading to intense
        attention from the press and movie-going public. Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger’s memory and the
        actor’s remarkable transformation was widely praised. It saw him posthumously awarded the Best Supporting Actor
        Oscar and changed the perception of what might be possible for actors to achieve in a superhero film.

        Jackson starred as Jules Winfield the partner in crime of John Travolta’s Vincent Vega, who both worked for
        crime boss Marsellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino wrote the part of Jules with Jackson in mind, but his first
        audition was overshadowed by Paul Calderón as Jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading. Producer
        Harvey Weinstein convinced him to audition a second time, and his performance of the final diner scene won over
        Tarantino. Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and his “Ezekiel” recitation was voted
        the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll.

        <h1>4. Christoph Waltz – Inglourious Basterds.</h1>

        Austrian actor Waltz seemed to appear from nowhere when he took the role of Hans Landa in Quentin Tarantino’s
        Inglourious Basterds. Despite being the major antagonist and a Nazi hunter of jews it’s hard not to enjoy his
        character even if at the same time we find ourselves despising his actions and what he stands for.

        <h1>5.Brad Pitt- The Fight Club (1999).</h1>

        </div>
        The role that challenges ‘Seven’ for his most notable. Teaming up again with that film’s director, David
        Fincher, Pitt takes on the role of Tyler Durden, a maverick ‘soap-maker’, who along with Edward Norton’s
        nameless lead form an underground fight club. Pitt and Norton go head to head as they wrestle for control of
        first the club, and secondly the secret anti-organisational project Tyler has created. Off the wall, crazy, mad,
        you name it, Pitt brings the chaos in this cult classic.

        <h1>6.Morgan Freeman- The Shawshank Redemption (1994).</h1>

        A movie so important, you can find it somewhere on cable at almost any time of the day or night, every single
        day. If you took a poll on the street of people asking them for their favorite Morgan Freeman movie, it’s a safe
        bet that The Shawshank Redemption would far and away be the most popular answer. For a movie that was a
        disappointment at the box office, that is pretty amazing.

        Freeman plays Red, a man whose been in jail for a long time when Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins arrives
        after he is sentenced to life for murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Red mentors Andy
        and their friendship grows. It’s a wonderful movie and Morgan Freeman’s portrayal of the convicted criminal with
        a heart of gold made millions of Gen Xers and Millennials who grew up watching the movie on cable consider
        Freeman one of the most beloved actors of all-time.

        <h1>7. Tom Hanks- Forrest Gump (1994).</h1>

        There are few movies more culturally recognizable and instantly quotable as 1994's Best Picture winning Forrest
        Gump. Director Robert Zemeckis' adored adaptation of Winston Gloom's 1986 novel proved the Back to the Future
        director was one of the most prestigious filmmakers of the late 20th century, and it cemented Tom Hanks' status
        as an A-list actor when he won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar after the actor's well-acclaimed
        performance in 1993's Philadelphia. But much like a box of chocolates, the filmmakers didn't know what they were
        going to get with this hit film, and the behind-the-scenes details surrounding the world-beloved movie prove it
        took lots of luck and hard-work to turn Forrest Gump into such a classic.
