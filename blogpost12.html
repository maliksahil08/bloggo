        <h1 class="font1">Travel restrictions during covid-19 delhi.</h1>
        <p class="font-1">Media are reporting that Indian passport holders can apply for tourist visas to the UAE if
            they have not been to India in the last 14 days.
            <br>The UAE’s latest rules, as announced by state carrier Etihad Airways, stipulate that Indian nationals
            who
            have a visa or residence permit issued by the US, UK, or an EU Member State can access its visa on arrival
            facility. Further, passengers can take a rapid PCR test six hours before their departure instead of four
            hours now. Quarantine rules will also apply.
            <br>The US eased its travel advisory for India on August 16, 2021, lowering it to Level 2 – which is
            considered
            as safe – following significant improvement in India’s COVID situation. See the Travel Health Notice from
            the CDC <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-2/coronavirus-india">here:</a>
            <br>Canada has extended the ban on direct flights from India for a fifth time this year (since April) – to
            September 21, 2021. Transport Canada stated: “passengers who travel to Canada from India via an indirect
            route will need to obtain a pre-departure negative COVID-19 molecular test result from a third country
            before continuing their journey to Canada… Travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 must
            provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days before departure,
            instead of a negative COVID-19 molecular test. This proof must be obtained in a third country before the
            continuation of the journey to Canada. You might need to seek entry and stay in a third country for at least
            14 days…”.
            <br>The Indian Bureau of Immigration noted the specific categories of foreign nationals who are permitted to
            enter India by water routes or by flights, including those under the Vande Bharat Mission, or ‘Air Bubble’
            (Bilateral Air Travel Arrangements) Scheme, or by any non-scheduled commercial flights as allowed by the
            Ministry of Civil Aviation in its notice MHA O.M. No.25022/24/2020-F.V/F.I dated October 09, 2020.
